## How to Run Code

After downloading the third party modules, please download or open the "Final version.ipynb" jupyter notebook in your favorite software (i.e., Anaconda) and run it. Please download/import the "train.csv" dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/g-research-crypto-forecasting/data) before executing the code. I have added the "asset_details.csv" under the "Data" folder, but the "train.csv" dataset was too big to be directly included there.

And note that: You need at least 4 GB RAM to run this code!!!

## Third Party Modules
+ Numpy
+ Pandas
+ Matplolib
+ Plotly
+ Seaborn
